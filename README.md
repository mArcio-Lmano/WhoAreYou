# Who Are You

## Overview

The Celebrities Classifier project is a three-part system designed to scrape images from the web, classify them using a machine learning model, and provide a user-friendly interface for interaction. The project's primary goal is to accurately identify and categorize images of celebrities.

## Project Structure

### 1. Web Scraper

The web scraper component is responsible for collecting images of celebrities from various online sources. It uses web scraping techniques to gather a diverse dataset for training and testing the model.

#### Setup and Usage

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the web scraper (Exemple)
python3 web_scraper.py "Kevin Hart" 25
```
### 2. Image Classification Model
<!-- 
The image classification model is the core of the project, responsible for accurately classifying the scraped images. It employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, possibly leveraging pre-trained models, to achieve high accuracy in celebrity image classification.

#### Setup and Usage

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the image classification model
python train_model.py

# Evaluate the model's performance
python evaluate_model.py
``` -->

### 3. User Interface

<!-- The user interface provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the Celebrities Classifier. Users can upload images, and the system will predict and display the celebrity present in the image.

#### Setup and Usage

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the user interface
python user_interface.py
``` -->
